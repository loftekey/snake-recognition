# descrition
after testing, this app is available for android 9.0 in Huawei Mate Pro 20.

As mention by the original tutorial in 
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/android
the most easy way to establish this application is through android studio
Then edit the build.gradle file and change the value of nativeBuildSystem to 'none' so that the project is built in the simplest way possible:
```
def nativeBuildSystem = 'none'
```
After Build and Generate APK, we can find two version of application in output folders of gradleBuild.

# model setting.
As this is a application for tensorflow, the model we generated by keras cannot be used directly, we need to use keras_to_tensorflow tools to froze the .h5 model into a single graph. put the transfered model into asset folder and change the value of below string variables in detectoractivity.java. After building, the labels list file will be written automatically.
 
```
TF_OD_API_MODEL_FILE = "file:///android_asset/frozen_inference_graph.pb"
TF_OD_API_LABELS_FILE = "file:///android_asset/snake_labels_list.txt"
```
